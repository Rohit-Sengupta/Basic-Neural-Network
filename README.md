# Basic-Neural-Network
The goal of this project was to have a deeper understanding of deep learning models and how neural networks learn so I used numpy and Object-Oriented Programming in Python to make multiple classes for a basic neural network

- Used Python and numpy to make classes for Neurons, Layers and finally the neural network class itself
- Implemented algortihms and functions to calculate outputs and gradient descent, Foward_pass/backpropagation algorithmn and Train-Test functions
- Tested model on MNIST dataset
(Accuracy before training 12% | Accuracy after training 83.6%)
